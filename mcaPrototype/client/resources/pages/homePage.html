            <h3>Doctor of Audiology</h3>
            <p>With busy and sometimes irregular schedules, I know it can be difficult to access ear and hearing health
                services. MCA was created in order to provide more convenient and accessible services.</p>
            <p>Music Industry Professionals (MIPs), I know first hand how important your ears are for understanding,
                creating, and performing music. As a music audiologist, my goal is to advocate for you and your ears.
                Let me help protect your passion, career, and livelihood.</p>
            <p>For those with hearing loss, treatment options can be difficult to navigate, use, and maintain. Without
                functioning devices, individuals can truly struggle with daily tasks. As a hearing aid expert, I can
                help restore your communication needs.</p>
